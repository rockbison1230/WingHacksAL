hello lilly

OK SO.
focusing on period poverty. we can have a website thar 1. brings notice to period poverty in the U.S. bc its a pressing issue. we would probabl have to mention lack of data surrounding it tbh.. anyway, ifnogrpahic type website.
i am thinking of trying to find a way for us to like. locate and find womens shelters where period products could be donated. or just locations in general that accept donations of period products? this would be like, makign a map and stuff. listing... i have an image in my head...

i think what we can do is have a react.js frontend, and a python backend.
